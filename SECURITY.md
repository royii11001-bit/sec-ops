# Security Implementation

This document details the security controls implemented in the SecOps CI/CD pipeline.

## Shift Left Security Approach

### Development Stage (SAST)
- **Bandit** analyzes Python code for security issues and vulnerabilities
- **Semgrep** provides multi-language security pattern detection
- **Safety** scans Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Catches security issues before they reach the build stage

### Build Stage (Container Security)
- **Trivy** scans images and dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Intelligent security gates** block critical vulnerabilities (with util-linux CVE exception)
- Dynamic image tagging with branch and commit SHA
- Secure container hardening during build

### Pre-Deployment Stage (DAST)
- **OWASP ZAP** with custom severity configuration tests the running application
- **Critical-only failure policy** - only SQL injection, XSS, and path traversal fail pipeline
- **Medium severity warnings** for security headers, cookies, and CSP issues
- Tests for runtime vulnerabilities that static analysis cannot detect

### Deployment Stage (Runtime Security)
- Non-root container execution
- Read-only filesystem and security constraints
- Resource limits and capability restrictions

### Tool Selection Criteria
1. **Cost efficiency** - Enterprise-grade security without licensing costs
2. **Performance impact** - Fast tools that don't slow development
3. **Operational simplicity** - Simple, working solutions without unnecessary complexity

## Security Controls Summary

### Code-Level Security
- **SAST**: Multi-tool approach with Bandit, Semgrep, and Safety
- **Dependencies**: Trivy scanning with intelligent critical vulnerability blocking
- **Secrets**: Built-in application secret pattern detection
- **Quality gates**: Automated blocking of unsafe code with smart exceptions

### Container Security
- **Base images**: Minimal python:3.11-slim to reduce attack surface
- **Scanning**: Pre-push vulnerability detection with Trivy
- **Dynamic tagging**: Branch-commit SHA format for precise image tracking
- **Execution**: Non-root user (UID 1000) with dropped capabilities

### Runtime Security
- **Filesystem**: Read-only with temporary volumes
- **Permissions**: Security capabilities dropped
- **Resources**: Memory and CPU limits
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and security validation

### Pipeline Security
- **Gates**: Critical vulnerabilities block deployments
- **Isolation**: Separate CI/CD pipelines
- **Audit**: Complete logging of security activities
- **Access**: Branch protection and review requirements

## Security Tools

**Bandit (Python SAST)**
- Specialized Python security vulnerability detection
- Fast scanning with low false positives
- Integrates seamlessly with CI/CD workflows

**Semgrep (Multi-language SAST)**
- Cross-language security pattern detection
- Community rules with regular updates
- Comprehensive coverage beyond Python

**Safety (Dependency Scanner)**
- Python dependency vulnerability detection
- Database of known security issues
- Prevents vulnerable package usage

**Trivy (Container Scanning)**  
- Fast, accurate vulnerability detection
- Covers both OS and application dependencies
- Intelligent security gates with smart filtering

**OWASP ZAP (DAST)**
- Industry standard web application security testing  
- Custom severity configuration (Critical=FAIL, Medium=WARN)
- Risk-based pipeline failure policy

## Key Security Metrics

- **Critical vulnerabilities blocked**: Pipeline failure rate due to security
- **Scan coverage**: Percentage of code/containers scanned
- **Remediation time**: Speed of security issue resolution
- **Gate effectiveness**: Success rate of security controls

This implementation demonstrates practical DevSecOps with automated security enforcement throughout the development lifecycle.
