# Security Implementation

This document details the security controls implemented in the SecOps CI/CD pipeline.

## Shift Left Security Approach

### Development Stage (SAST)
- GitHub CodeQL analyzes Python code for vulnerabilities
- Catches security issues before they reach the build stage
- Integrated into developer workflow through pull request checks

### Build Stage (Container Security)
- Trivy scans images and dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Critical vulnerabilities block the pipeline
- Cosign signs images for supply chain integrity

### Pre-Deployment Stage (DAST)
- OWASP ZAP tests the running application
- Validates security controls in a live environment
- Tests for runtime vulnerabilities that static analysis cannot detect

### Deployment Stage (Runtime Security)
- Non-root container execution
- Read-only filesystem and security constraints
- Resource limits and capability restrictions

### Tool Selection Criteria
1. **Cost efficiency** - Enterprise-grade security without licensing costs
2. **Performance impact** - Fast tools that don't slow development
3. **Operational simplicity** - Simple, working solutions without unnecessary complexity

## Security Controls Summary

### Code-Level Security
- **SAST**: GitHub CodeQL for vulnerability detection
- **Dependencies**: Trivy scanning with critical vulnerability blocking
- **Secrets**: GitHub secret scanning integration
- **Quality gates**: Automated blocking of unsafe code

### Container Security
- **Base images**: Minimal python:3.11-slim to reduce attack surface
- **Scanning**: Pre-push vulnerability detection with Trivy
- **Signing**: Cosign for supply chain integrity
- **Execution**: Non-root user with dropped capabilities

### Runtime Security
- **Filesystem**: Read-only with temporary volumes
- **Permissions**: Security capabilities dropped
- **Resources**: Memory and CPU limits
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and security validation

### Pipeline Security
- **Gates**: Critical vulnerabilities block deployments
- **Isolation**: Separate CI/CD pipelines
- **Audit**: Complete logging of security activities
- **Access**: Branch protection and review requirements

## Security Tools

**GitHub CodeQL (SAST)**
- Native GitHub integration, no additional setup
- Comprehensive Python vulnerability detection
- Automated pull request security checks

**Trivy (Container Scanning)**  
- Fast, accurate vulnerability detection
- Covers both OS and application dependencies
- Free with regular database updates

**OWASP ZAP (DAST)**
- Industry standard web application security testing
- Complements static analysis with runtime testing
- Configurable scan depth and reporting

**Cosign (Image Signing)**
- CNCF project with keyless signing
- GitHub OIDC integration
- Supply chain attack prevention

## Key Security Metrics

- **Critical vulnerabilities blocked**: Pipeline failure rate due to security
- **Scan coverage**: Percentage of code/containers scanned
- **Remediation time**: Speed of security issue resolution
- **Gate effectiveness**: Success rate of security controls

This implementation demonstrates practical DevSecOps with automated security enforcement throughout the development lifecycle.
