# Threat Analysis
This document provides a focused threat assessment for the SecOps CI/CD pipeline, identifying key attack vectors and implemented security controls.

## Quick Threat Analysis

| Attack Vector | Current Controls | Risk Level | Status |
|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| **Code Injection** | CodeQL SAST, input validation | Medium | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Dependency Vulnerabilities** | Trivy scanning, critical blocking | High | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Container Escape** | Non-root user, capability dropping | Medium | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Supply Chain Attack** | Image signing with Cosign | High | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Secrets Exposure** | GitHub secrets, no hardcoded keys | Medium | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Read-only filesystem, security constraints | Medium | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Runtime Attacks** | OWASP ZAP DAST, health checks | Medium | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Resource Exhaustion** | Container memory limits, timeouts | Low | ✅ Mitigated |

## Security Architecture Overview

### Threat Model Assumptions

**Assets Protected:**
- Application source code and dependencies
- Container images and deployment artifacts  
- CI/CD pipeline integrity and secrets
- Production runtime environment

**Threat Actors:**
- External attackers targeting vulnerabilities
- Malicious dependencies or supply chain compromises
- Insider threats with repository access
- Automated attacks and vulnerability exploitation

### Attack Surface Analysis

**Primary Attack Vectors:**
1. **Application Layer**: Code vulnerabilities, dependency flaws
2. **Container Layer**: Image vulnerabilities, runtime misconfigurations  
3. **Pipeline Layer**: CI/CD injection, secret exposure
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Host vulnerabilities, network attacks

**Security Boundaries:**
- GitHub repository access controls and branch protection
- Docker container isolation and security constraints
- CI/CD pipeline permissions and secret management
- Runtime environment hardening and monitoring


This threat model is designed to evolve with the changing security landscape and operational requirements of the SecOps pipeline.
